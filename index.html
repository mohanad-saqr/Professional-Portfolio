                 <p>Hi, my name is Mohanad Saqr, and welcome to my professional portfolio page. This profile 
                        will provide a brief backround on myself, and will showcase some of the repositories I've worked on.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        My main interests and hobbies, outside of coding, are sports, geopolitics, and nature! 
                    </p>
                    <p>I am a graduate from the University of Toronto with an Honours B.A in Economics and Political Science. I started working in IT in 2015 as an Associate Business Systems Analyst.</p>
                    <p>I made the decision to pursue coding and software development after my many years interacting with Developers, Engineers, Database Administrators, and System Architects. I have great admiration and respect for the capabilities and efficiencies of computer science, and Iâ€™ve embarked on a challenging journey to fully immerse myself into the world of software development.
