# Professional-Portfolio
This portfolio allows the user to learn more about me.  The motivation for this project is to build a portfolio and website that can showcase my skills and projects as I continue my growth as a full-stack developer. By building this portfolio, I now have a repository to diplay all of my past and current projects, to allow colleagues, potential employers, and others alike to follow along my coding journey.

## Description
Welcome to my Portfolio page. This page will contain details about my coding backroung, and highlight some of the Respositories I've been able to deploy thus far. This project is built with HTML and CSS.
